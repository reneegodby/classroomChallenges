/*
Loops, Conditionals, and Functions Challenge
Challenge yourself by creating a callback function that detects whether a number is even, odd, or if it even is a number, and returns a value based on that information.

After you have implemented the number feature, create a loop that iterates from 0 to 10, and give the callback function the number the loop is currently on.

Hint: To help you see what comes back from the function, consider saving it in a variable and console.log it.

You will use the index.js file in the file directory to solve this challenge.

To test that your challenge meets the requirements, click on the ✓ on the left side panel to open up tests, and then click the run tests button.

To view the results of the test, click on the console window on the right or bottom section of the Replit editor.

Requirements
Here, you are given a boilerplate function called called 'callback'.

Your procedure is to modify the function to take in a number.

When that number is even, the function should return 'the number is even'.
When that number is odd, the function should return 'the number is odd'.
When the number is neither even or odd, the function should return 'what is this?'.
Your index.js file contains a loop that utilizes this callback function.
*/

 
  let callback = (num) => {
    if (num % 2 === 0) {
      return ('The number is even');
    } else if(num % 2 >= 1){
      return ('The number is odd');
    } else{
      return ("What is this?");
    }
  } 
  callback(8)
  
 
  // Test your callback function with the loop here!
  
  
  for (i = 0; i <= 10; i++){
    console.log(callback(i));
  }
  
  
  
  // Please do not modify this!
  module.exports = callback;
